Build the project in Android Studio



Notes : I commented out the .gitsubmodules because theupstream wasn't inline with the primary project.



1) Make sure in `/sdcard/Devilution` exists 
2) Copy  `androidbutton` image content into `/sdcard/Devilution`. 
3) Move `diabdat.mpq` (has to be lowercase name) and `diablo.ini` to `/sdcard/Android/data/org.diasurgical.devilutionx/`


To compile all you need to do is open the Android Studio and click the play button.

If you don't want to compile there is a [RELEASE](https://github.com/ApertureSecurity/devilutionX-android/blob/master/release/app-debug.apk) 

YOU MUST OWN THE GAME INORDER FOR THIS TO WORK!
