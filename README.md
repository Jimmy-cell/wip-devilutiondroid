# Compile

1) Open and Build the project in Android Studio

That is it!

# Notes

Notes : I commented out the .gitsubmodules because the up stream wasn't inline with the primary project.

When you run the game the first time it will create the needed folders in  `/sdcard/` .
When the game first runs it will copy the files from `/sdcard` to a created `/sdcard/devilutionx/`

You can create these folders yourself or just exit the game and copy the needed files to them once the first initial run has taken place.

# Play
1) Copy  `androidimage` image content into `/sdcard/`.
2) Move `diabdat.mpq` (has to be lowercase name) to `/sdcard/`


To compile all you need to do is open the Android Studio and click the play button.

YOU MUST OWN THE GAME IN ORDER FOR THIS TO WORK!

# TODO
Updates coming soon, working with Ajenbo to unify the project and make several fixes in Upstream [DevilutionX](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX)
