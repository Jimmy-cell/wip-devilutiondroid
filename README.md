# Compile

Build the project in Android Studio



Notes : I commented out the .gitsubmodules because theupstream wasn't inline with the primary project.

When you run the game the first time it will create the needed folders in  `/sdcard/Android/data/org.diasurgical.devilutionx/` .

You can create these folders yourself or just exit the game and copy the needed files to them once the first initial run has taken place.

# Play 
1) Copy  `androidbutton` image content into `/sdcard/Android/data/org.diasurgical.devilutionx/`. 
2) Move `diabdat.mpq` (has to be lowercase name) to `/sdcard/Android/data/org.diasurgical.devilutionx/`


To compile all you need to do is open the Android Studio and click the play button.

If you don't want to compile there is a [RELEASE](https://github.com/Jimmy-cell/wip-devilutiondroid/releases/download/1.1b/devilution.apk) 

YOU MUST OWN THE GAME INORDER FOR THIS TO WORK!
